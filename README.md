# Melanoma-Detection
A CNN algorithm for classification of possible melanoma diagnosis using skin lesion images. The training data for lesion diagnosis which consists of
10015 images are downloaded from ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion
Analysis towards Melanoma Detection‚Äù. There are seven possible disease categories:
Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevus, Basal Cell Carcinoma,
Actinic Keratosis, Benign Keratosis Dermatofibroma and
Vascular Lesion.

Created a CNN for melanoma classification using some of the ideas fundamental to LeNet, which was applied to recognize hand-written
characters. Considering the fact that we need a deeper network for this task,I added more layers and the final version of the network consists of 7 layers The network has four convolutional and three pooling layers for feature extraction, and one fully-connected layers, in the end for classification.
This contribution improves the performance of the network, despite having some additional features which increase the
training time.
